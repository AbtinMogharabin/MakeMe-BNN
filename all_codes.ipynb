        "### Training Loop:\n",
        "\n",
        "The `train_model` function is a versatile training loop designed for PyTorch models, providing flexibility in selecting optimizers, loss functions, and various hyperparameters. Here's a brief description of its key features and how it utilizes different parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Optimizer Selection**:\n",
        "   - The function allows the choice between 'SGD' (Stochastic Gradient Descent) and 'Adam' optimizers via the `Optimizer_type` parameter. This is achieved by checking the value of `Optimizer_type` and initializing the respective optimizer with the specified `learning_rate`, `Weight_decay`, and `Momentum` (for SGD).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Loss Function Selection**:\n",
        "   - The function supports multiple loss functions, including 'CrossEntropyLoss', 'MSELoss', and a custom loss function 'CustomMAPLoss'. The appropriate loss function is selected based on the `Loss_fn` parameter. For 'CustomMAPLoss', the `Num_classes` and `Weight_decay` parameters are used for initialization.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Learning Rate Scheduler**:\n",
        "   - A MultiStepLR scheduler is used to adjust the learning rate at specified milestones. The `milestones` parameter defines the epochs at which the learning rate is reduced by a factor specified by `gamma_lr`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Training and Validation Loop**:\n",
        "   - The function contains a standard training loop where it iterates over the training dataset, computes the loss, performs backpropagation, and updates the model parameters.\n",
        "   - After each epoch, the model is evaluated on the validation dataset, and the average validation loss is computed and stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Hyperparameters**:\n",
        "   - Various hyperparameters such as `epochs`, `learning_rate`, `Weight_decay`, `Momentum`, and `Num_classes` can be adjusted to fine-tune the training process according to specific needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Model Saving**:\n",
        "   - The trained model's state dictionary is saved to a specified path (`save_path`) after the training is complete.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Loss Visualization**:\n",
        "   - The function plots the training and validation losses over epochs for easy visualization of the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This design provides flexibility and ease of experimentation with different training configurations, making it suitable for various deep learning tasks."
